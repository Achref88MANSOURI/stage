"""`elasticsearch_related_alerts` — architecture §6 tool 6. Alongside
`tools/detection_rules.py::detection_rule_lookup` (a second ES call, against
`so-detection`, covered in that file), this is the Elasticsearch evidence
Stage 1 gathers.

`elasticsearch_related_alerts` answers "what OTHER ALERTS fired near this
one" — same host/user/IOCs in the last N hours. Feeds Stage 5's velocity
multiplier and Stage 3's kill-chain reasoning.

**`elasticsearch_process_history` (architecture §6 tool 7, "what OTHER
PROCESSES ran on this host") was REMOVED 2026-09-06, user-directed.** It
queried `.ds-logs-endpoint.events.process-*` with no suspiciousness filter —
just `host.name` + a 24h `@timestamp` window — returning up to 50 process
events, legitimate activity included by design (the judgment of
legitimate-vs-not was meant to happen at Stage 3's reasoning step, not at
query time). User decision: this raw ancestry context wasn't worth its
prompt-size cost. `ProcessEvent` (`schemas/evidence.py`),
`RawEvidence.process_history_24h`, and `nodes/gather.py`'s dataset-gated
call (`alert.event_dataset == "endpoint.events.process"`) are gone with it.
`Process.entity_id`/`.parent_entity_id`/`.ancestry` on the alerting process
itself (`schemas/alert.py`, populated by `alert_builder.py`) are UNRELATED
and untouched — those describe the one process that fired the alert, not a
host-wide history query.

**`elasticsearch_related_alerts` is engine-branched (fixed 2026-08-21, gap #17).**
Two independent, real backends, selected by `investigation_profile` (set once in
`alert_builder.py`, per `CanonicalAlert.investigation_profile` — see
`schemas/alert.py`'s `InvestigationProfile` docstring, which already named this
dispatch as the intended design):

- `investigation_profile == "endpoint_behavior"` (Sigma) -> `_related_alerts_sigma`,
  querying `config.ES_ALERTS_INDEX` (`logs-detections.alerts-so*`) by
  `event_data.host.name` / `event_data.user.name` / `event_data.related.{ip,hash}`.
  Unchanged from the original implementation; see the field-presence probe below.
- `investigation_profile == "network_threat"` (Suricata) -> `_related_alerts_suricata`,
  querying `config.ES_SURICATA_ALERTS_INDEX` (`logs-suricata.alerts-so*`) by
  `network.community_id` / `source.ip` / `destination.ip` — all three tier-1
  live-confirmed 100%-populated across 254k+ real Suricata alert docs (2026-08-21
  field census). Suricata alerts have no `event_data` wrapper at all — the fields
  the Sigma path reads simply don't exist on this document shape, which is why the
  original single-index, single-field-set implementation silently returned `[]` for
  every Suricata alert (queries `ES_ALERTS_INDEX`, which is 100% Sigma; even had it
  queried the right index, `event_data.host.name` etc. don't exist there either) with
  no `Gap` logged — a real bug, not just the (separate, workflow-level) ingestion gap
  documented in CLAUDE.md's Suricata section.
- Any other profile (`malicious_file`, `generic`) -> no verified correlation query
  exists yet for that document shape (no live YARA/Strelka alert has ever fired in
  this deployment to verify a query against — implementation guide §0.1). Returns an
  explicit `Gap` rather than silently running the Sigma-shaped query and getting a
  meaningless empty result, which is what happened before this fix.

Do not add a third index/field-set to `elasticsearch_related_alerts` on inference
alone (e.g. for `malicious_file`) — verify a real alert of that shape first, per
implementation guide §2's discipline, the same way the Suricata path above was
built from a live field census, not guessed from ECS documentation.

**`ioc.*` is never read here.** The Sigma alert document real fixture has an
`ioc.rule.uuid` that looks like a tempting shortcut for `rule.uuid` — per CLAUDE.md's
ground-truth hierarchy, `ioc.*` comes from a custom development-time pipeline layered
on top of Security Onion, is not corroborating evidence, and must never be built on.
`rule.uuid` (top level) is the correct field for both engines.

Sigma-path observable/IOC correlation matches against the ECS entity-rollup fields
`event_data.related.ip` and `event_data.related.hash` — Elastic Agent's own
aggregation of every IP / hash seen on a process event, populated independently of
which specific sub-field (process hash, DNS answer, network connection, ...) they
came from. Live field-presence probe against the real alerts index on 2026-08-13
(`_source` filtered `exists` query, `size=1`, count via `hits.total.value`):

    event_data.related.ip                4708 of ~7700 docs populated
    event_data.related.hash               332 of ~7700 docs populated
    event_data.destination.ip                0 docs populated
    event_data.network.protocol              0 docs populated
    event_data.dns.question.name             0 docs populated
    event_data.url.{original,domain,full}    0 docs populated (all three)

`external_ips` and file hashes are therefore matched against `related.ip` /
`related.hash` on the Sigma path. `domains` and `urls` remain UNMATCHED on BOTH
paths, deliberately — not a guess deferred for later, but live-confirmed absence:
0% of the Sigma alerts index AND 0% of the 254k+ real Suricata alerts index (checked
both ECS names like `dns.question.name`/`http.request.method` and Suricata-native
names like `dns.rrname`/`http.hostname`/`tls.sni`, 2026-08-21 field census) carry any
DNS/HTTP/TLS field — this Suricata sensor is configured alert-only, not full EVE
firehose (gap #14), so no domain/URL/DNS evidence exists anywhere in this deployment
today regardless of engine. **Trap found during that census, worth restating here
since it is exactly the shape of field this file's correlation logic would reach
for**: `dns.query_name` IS populated on the Suricata alerts index (100% of docs) but
is NOT real DNS data — sampled directly, it is the firing rule's own raw `content:`
match bytes, misrouted into a DNS-shaped field by the ingest pipeline. It appeared on
a doc whose rule is an HTTP backdoor signature with zero DNS component. Do not wire
this field into any future domain/URL correlation clause.

NEVER RAISES. Returns `(list[AlertSummary], Gap | None)`:
- success (including zero hits) -> `(list, None)`
- nothing to query on (no correlation input given, or unsupported engine) -> `([], Gap)`, ES never called
- backend failure / timeout -> `([], Gap)` with the transport error reason
