"""`case_action` — creates or merges a TheHive case from the triage result.

NOT part of architecture v4's six stages. A deliberate deviation from §1/§3's
"read-only, n8n owns case mutation" design, user-directed 2026-08-21 — see
CLAUDE.md's "Case action" entry for the full record of that decision. This is
the first node in the pipeline with real, externally-visible side effects.

Driven ONLY by `verdict.correlation_decision.action` — per the user's explicit
directive, every alert results in either a new case or a merge,
unconditionally. There is no `needs_review`/`close_fp` hold-off here:
`TriageVerdict`'s richer fields (verdict, recommended_action, reasoning,
summary, citations) become CONTENT written into the case, never a gate on
whether to act. `recommended_action == "merge_and_retier"` is the one place
those richer fields DO change behavior — it triggers an extra severity-bump
call on top of the merge, since TheHive's merge endpoint doesn't accept field
overrides in the same call (see `tools/thehive.py`'s module docstring).

This node makes 1-3 real HTTP calls to a live TheHive instance and needs its
own timeout/Gap handling. `TriageResult.case_action` is `None` until a caller
runs this node and assigns it.

**v6 redesign (2026-09-06)**: `case_action(verdict, evidence)` takes ONE
object now, not two — `correlation_decision`/`evidence_situation` live
directly on `TriageVerdict` (schemas/verdict.py) since the old Stage 3
(`ContextualAssessment`, deleted) / Stage 4 split is gone. Every
`context.X` read in this file becomes `verdict.X`; nothing else about the
write logic changes.

**v5 redesign (`newdesign.md` §5, §8) — no more `PriorityScore` parameter.**
The numeric/matrix scoring stage this node used to receive a `priority:
PriorityScore` from is deleted entirely; `priority_band`/`priority_reasoning`
now come straight from `verdict` (`TriageVerdict.priority_band`/
`.priority_reasoning`, assigned directly by Stage 4's LLM). `PRIORITY_TO_
HIVE_SEVERITY` moves here from the deleted `scoring_config.py` as a
module-level constant — same mapping, unchanged.

NEVER RAISES to its caller — every TheHive write failure becomes
`CaseActionResult(success=False, error=...)`, same contract as every other
node/tool in this repo.

**2026-08-23 correction — observable writes now come from Stage 4, not
Stage 3 directly.** Previously this node called `thehive.
add_extracted_observables(case_id, context.extracted_observables)` — Stage
3's raw extraction, written straight to TheHive without Stage 4 ever
weighing in. That skipped the whole point of TASK 5 (`prompts/analyst_agent.py`):
Stage 4 was supposed to be the one deciding what's serious. Fixed: this node
now writes `verdict.actionable_observables` instead — Stage 4's judgment on
EVERY observable it was shown (not a filtered subset, see that prompt's
module docstring), each carrying a `confidence`. `add_extracted_observables`
is retired from `tools/thehive.py` along with this change — its "write
everything, don't check what's already there" approach is exactly what a
call site keyed on Stage 4's per-item confidence + potential duplicates
against already-known observables shouldn't do blindly; `_write_actionable_
observables` below replaces it.

This can only run AFTER `create_case_from_alert`/`merge_alert_into_case`
succeeds — a "new" case has no `case_id` until the create call returns one,
so the write (and the existing-observable lookup that avoids duplicating
one already on the case) happens here, in Stage 6, never earlier.

    """For each of Stage 4's judged observables: reuse its id if a matching
    value is already on the case, otherwise create it and capture the new
    id TheHive assigns. Returns `(enriched_list, written_count,
    failed_count)` — `enriched_list` is the SAME items with `observable_id`
    filled in (or left `None` on a genuine create failure — still returned,
    never dropped, so the LLM's judgment survives in the output even when
    the TheHive write itself didn't). `written_count` covers both reused and
    newly-created items — either way the case now has that observable.

    Tags written reflect Stage 4's own judgment (`disposition:<value>`,
    `confidence:<value>`) rather than the old blanket `["react",
    "malicious"]` every process-path observable used to get regardless of
    how confident that judgment actually was — that convention doesn't carry
    over cleanly now that low-confidence/"monitor" items are written too.
    `ioc=True` only for block/quarantine; a "monitor" item is worth watching,
    not necessarily an indicator of compromise.

    2026-08-23, user-directed: the observable's TheHive `message` (its
    description in the UI) now states the recommendation up front, followed
    by Stage 4's reasoning, rather than reasoning alone — so an analyst
    reading the observable in TheHive sees the recommended action without
    having to cross-reference the tags.

    2026-08-23 fix — race with TheHive's own alert-to-case observable import.
    Live-caught: on the "new case" path, `create_case_from_alert` triggers
    TheHive's own background import of the ALERT's observables into the just
    -created case (visible as TheHive's own `re&ct:*`/`field:*` tags on those
    rows) — an async process not guaranteed complete by the time the
    existence pre-check above runs a moment later. Result observed on a real
    case: 4 of 6 items the pre-check missed hit TheHive's own uniqueness
    constraint at create time (`"Observable already exists"`), and the real
    ID for each was silently lost (marked failed, Stage 4's judgment
    attached to nothing). On a create failure matching that specific TheHive
    error, re-fetch and reuse the real existing ID instead of discarding it
    — same "recovered, not lost" contract this function already gives a
    value that was visible in the pre-check. This does NOT re-apply Stage
    4's tags/message onto that pre-existing (TheHive-auto-imported) row —
    no update-observable endpoint exists in this codebase yet; recovering
    the ID (so the value is at least correctly represented in the output)
    is this fix's scope. Also does not address the rarer case observed in
    the same live run where TheHive did NOT reject a colliding create
    outright (a duplicate `ip` observable resulted) — that failure mode
    produces no error to catch here and needs a different fix if it recurs.
